		<h2>Free Software</h2>
		<p>(Regarding <i>free as in freedom</i> software) Being a Linux user, it's not too odd to assume that I am at least somewhat an advocate for free software. However, I have my own critiques of free software, and I certainly do not use exclusively free software. (I use Arch Linux and Discord every single day). ALMOST everything I use is open-source, but this is because I prefer such programs typically. Open-source software tends to be better, especially for power users. However, I certainly do not <i>require</i> all software I run to be Free or open source. That is due to  a number of reasons. First, I do not agree with the entire point of the free software movement. I agree that computer users should retain their freedoms while using a computer. Such freedoms naturally extend to developers. I believe developers should have the freedom to publish their software as they wish, with whatever restrictions they wish to use. Of course, users who are conscious of their privacy and freedoms shall make the <i>choice</i> to use free software. They will be happy with what they have, while those who do not care may be happy with less-freedom centric software. The second reason i have for not advocating free software is that the FSF's free software model is too restrictive. As <a href="https://digdeeper.neocities.org/ghost/freetardism.html">this article</a> explains, the 4 freedoms are ridiculously strict and certainly to not make a good or compelling point to developers considering making their software FOSS. </p>
		<h2>Minimalism</h2>
		<p>When computing, I use quite a range of software. For my web browser, I use firefox, which is extremely bloated and feature-packed. For my pdf viewer, however, I use zathura, which is pretty minimal, especially in comparision to the competition. For image viewing, I use feh, which is somewhere in the middle. Now then, with that in mind, let's look at how I use each of those 3 programs. I am on the internet for often hours a day. I use it as my main form of communication (discord) and I surf the web quite vigorously. I do my homework using google suite and other online services. Point is, I have firefox open for hours every day. Moving on to zathura. I use zathura to view pdfs very infrequently. It is pretty much situationally used whenever I need to use it. And for feh, well, I do a lot of image viewing, but it is often quick and simple. I don't need anything extraordinary in my image viewer, so I don't use an extraordinary image viewer. Basically, I think that nobody should use exclusively minimal or exclusively heavy software. Tailor it to your computing routines. I disagree with using minimal software for no reason. Using a minimal web browser would do nothing but annoy me and be unsufficient for my needs.  However, if I barely use something, such as in the case of my pdf reader, I see no point in having a large, resource sucking application with which I ignore 90% of its features. One quick note I would like to make is the difference between minimal software and <i>light</i> software. Vim, for example, is extremely light, but sure as hell <b>not</b> minimal. It comes with a stupid amount of features and I would not reccomend using it unless you often program or write documents with it (as I do). Software can be light but not minimal, or minimal but not light. Lightweightness is objectively good, assuming it has the same features of a program that is not lightweight.</p>
