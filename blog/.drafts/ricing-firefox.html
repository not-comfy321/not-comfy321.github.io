Firefox is, in my opinion, the most extensively customizable modern
mainstream web browser. The customizability of Firefox is, in fact, the
sole reason for which I prefer Firefox to, say, Ungoogled Chromium. There
are a few good guides out there, which I will be linking at the beginning
of each section, but they are scattered about. I think there should be one
universal and encompassing guide to ricing Firefox.

<h2>I) Homepage/New Tab Page</h2>

	To start off, we will be reviewing one of the two of these four sections which
	is not specific to Firefox: homepages. The concept is very simple:
	a webpage which is functionally useful when you open a blank Firefox
	window. It may include anything. Common elements include:<br>
	-Links to frequently visited sites<br>
	-Search bar<br>
	-Weather<br>
	-Autistic /biz/ crypto prices<br>
	-Waifus telling you to have a nice day<br>
	Point is, there is plenty of creativity you can use here, and its not rare that I will
	see someone do something new and cool in a homepage. To create a basic, /wg/ ready
	homepage, you can simply make one using HTML+CSS (although you may need to write JS
	scripts for some things, like weather). This can be done fairly easily. If you're lazy,
	you can perform the age-old art of <i>stealing other people's shit</i>. See above, there
	are tons and tons of homepages people make. I'm currently using one I stole off of someone
	else (and changed a bit) but I am appalled at how bloated it is and I will probably write
	my own soon. Once you have a homepage you like, it's time to apply it. You can host the
	html file wherever you want. I recommend hosting it on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>
	. Once it's hosted, go to <a href="about:preferences#home">about:preferences</a>, and
	change <b>Homepage and new windows</b> to <b>Custom URLs...</b>. This is all you need to do if you
	just want to change your homepage. However, chances are, you also want to change your
	newtab. Unfortunately, Firefox removed our ability to do custom newtabs a few updates ago,
	so I use the plugin <a
				    href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/addon/custom-new-tab-page/">
		Custom New Tab</a> to change the newtab page. Just set the newtab to your hosted
	file, and you should be good to go.
</p>
<h2>II) Stylus</h2>
<p>
<b><i>Relevant Links: <a href="userstyles.org">Userstyles</a></i></b><br>
In case you're unaware, <a
				href=https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/addon/styl-us/>Stylus</a>
is a plugin for Firefox and Chrome that lets you use your own custom CSS on websites. The
tool is pretty cool and can lead to some very nice site designs. Stylus also lets you use
<b>Global Styles</b>, which is css that will apply to every website you visit. While it
may sound good to have a consistent style among all websites you visit, you soon realize
that Global Styles are autistic and will make 80% of websites look like garbage
(seriously, just don't use them). Admittedly, Stylus can be somewhat difficult to use
sometimes. It requires you to study the website's CSS and mostly involves a lot of
tinkering. I recommend writing CSS for only websites you frequent, if you value your time.
Of course, <a href=userstyles.org>userstyles.org</a> has a ton of good styles you can
steal. One thing to note, before I wrap up this section, is that I would NOT recommend
writing Stylus CSS for 4chan. (INSERT SHILL MODE)
Use <a href="https://github.com/ccd0/4chan-x">4chan x</a>
+ <a href="https://github.com/KevinParnell/OneeChan">Oneechan</a> for a significantly
better browsing experience and a very easy and extensible customization system (LEAVE
SHILL MODE). You'll also need <a
				      href=https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/374723-oneechan-4channel-update>this</a>
*monkey script to use Oneechan now.
</p>
<h2>III) userchrome.css</h2>
<p>
<b><i>Relevant Links: <a href=https://www.userchrome.org/>Userchrome.org</a>, <a
			 href=https://www.reddit.com/r/FirefoxCSS>/r/Firefoxcss</a>
</b></i>
Userchrome.css is one one of the best things about ricing Firefox. It lets you change the
way the browser's interface looks, including (almost) everything from tabs to
scrollbars. It can be a little tricky to actually get started with a userChrome.css file. 
<b>Create userchrome.css</b> in <b>~/.mozilla/chrome</b> (create this folder if
necessary.).
To be honest, userchrome.css can be much more difficult to tinker with than site styles.
You will have to become familiar with the wack-ass Firefox CSS elements and, if you want
to do anything other than recolor stuff on the browser, you will require a more extended
knowledge of CSS. That is why I recommend stealing something off of <a
									    href=https://www.reddit.com/r/Firefoxcss>/r/Firefoxcss</a>
and modifying it to your liking (Sorting by top...all time can give you actual themes and
not just questions). Me, being the lazy fuaarrrrk that I am use a modified version of <a
											      href=https://www.reddit.com/r/FirefoxCSS/comments/7ignsk/oneline_flat_interface_dark_light/>
this</a>. 
</p>
<h2>Themes</h2>
<p>
Last, but not least (actually, yes, least) are Firefox themes. Firefox themes are
necessary to color things like the URL bar which cannot be changed by userchrome.css. You
can find many Firefox themes on the <a
					    href=https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/themes/>Firefox
					    Addons Catalog</a>
However, you will find that <i>LITERALLY EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE</i> is <i>garbage</i>.
Seriously, it's astounding how bad these are. So, what we will do is make our own Firefox
theme. Making a theme isn't too bad, but applying one can be a pain. To make a theme, you
should go about like you were making any Firefox addon. Create a <b>manifest.json</b> file
and populate it like this: (this is my theme)
<pre><code>
{
"manifest_version": 2,
"name": "fft",
"version": "0.3",
"theme": {
    "colors": {
       "accentcolor": "#0c0c0c",
       "textcolor": "white",
       "toolbar": "#0c0c0c",
       "toolbar_text": "white",
       "toolbar_field": "#0c0c0c",
       "toolbar_field_border": "#0c0c0c",
       "toolbar_field_text": "white",
       "toolbar_top_separator": "#ffa64f",
       "toolbar_bottom_separator": "#0c0c0c",
       "toolbar_vertical_separator": "#0c0c0c"
    }
  }
}
</pre></code>
Then package it into a .zip or .xpi:<br>
<code> zip -r -FS theme.zip * </code><br>
Now that you have this, we can "test" out the theme.
<ul>
	<li>1) Go to <a href="about:debugging">about:debugging</a></li>
	<li>2) Click "Load Temporary Add-On"</li>
	<li>3) Choose your file.</li>
</ul>
HOWEVER!!!<br>
Doing this, every time you restart Firefox, you will have lost your theme. So in order to
avert this ill fate, we will (prepare yourself) PUBLISH OUR THEME. Thanks """MOZ://A""".
So, basically you will have to go through a small process to get your theme published. 
<ul>
	<li>1)Visit <a href=https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/>Firefox Addons</a> and
	make a """MOZ://A""" account</li>
	<li>2)Go to the <a href=https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/">developer
			club</a> and click <b>Submit a New Add-on</b></li>

</ul>
<br><br>
Anyways, this is just a very bare bones guide to ricing Firefox. For specific details, use
the sources at the top of each section and google. Maybe ask around in /wg/ or /g/
threads. Have a nice day!
