<h1>100% Electronicon LA</h1>

<p>
Last weekened I attended 100% ElectroniCON 2 in Los Angeles, and I had a great experience. In case you're unfamiliar, this is the second installment in a series of vaporwave-centered music festivals (vaporwave, for the unfamiliar, is an cultish internet-born music genre with emphasis on a musical and visual surreal aesthetic, with a huge range of sounds and distinct styles). I am now making a blog post to share my experience with the festival and talk about the artists, people, and merchandise of the event.<br>
The simplest way to describe the experience is really to just say that it was a ton of fun. It was incredible to see such a weird and almost entirely anonymous and internet-based community come together in real life. Almost everyone there was, quite clearly, a big vaporwave fan and I had a countless number of discussions with other atendees. The event was a 10 hour beast that went from 2pm to midnight on a Saturday, followed by another couple hours at an afterparty that I unfortunately couldn't attend because I'm too young (this event was also my first time seeing live music, so that might have put particular weight on it). I met people who I only knew from vaporwave Discord servers and I made more than one new friend. I was amazed by the community and how nice everyone was. Of course, I didn't attend Electronicon to talk to people. So, what artists did I see and how were they?<br>
</p>
<h3>Equip</h3>
<p>
The first artist I saw was Equip, known for his video-game-OST-modelling vaporwave records and aquatic style. Equip was wearing his crazy Cursebreaker X costume, featuring pointy ears and a horn on his head (he actually gave his ears to the audience). It was a great set, but to be honest it was probably my personal least favorite of the festival. There was decent energy from the audience and the artist himself was very down-to-earth. In fact, there was nothing <em>bad</em> about his performance at all. He even got Vaperror to make a surprise appearance for the last song, which was hype as hell. It just wasn't quite as spectacular as the others.
</p>
<h3>FrankJavCee</h3>
<p>
Next, I saw FrankJavCee play. FrankJavCee is a Youtuber who has made a lot of videos related to obscure internet music (like vaporwave) which are filled with memes and fun. So, naturally, his performance was pretty meme-heavy. This had quite an effect, and a positive one. When "Thicc Boy Season" played, I realized what I was in for. Not long after, I got knocked over moshing to "Everybody Gangsta 'til the Pants Start Walking". He also got his girlfriend to sing, which was great. I met some friends at the set and all-around had a great time.
</p> 
<h3>INTERNET CLUB</h3>
<p>
Internet Club was next. This was his first time ever performing live. I was at the set very early and very excited to hear him. Despite some rude remarcks from some asshole in the audience who didn't appreciate his slow trance-like style, his performance was really good. I got a bit lost listening to the long hypnogenic drones of Internet Club.
</p> 
<h3>Yeule</h3>
<p>
Next up was up-and-coming dreampop singer Yeule. I only caught the second half of Yeule, but it was still a respectable and fun performance. Yeule's style is probably not the best when played live, but I think she dealt with it perfectly.
</p> 
<h3>Death's Dynamic Shroud</h3>
<p>
After Yeule, I got ready for the DDS performance. DDS is probably my single favorite vaporwave artist so I made sure to show up early as to secure a position in the front. Tech and James were present, and they certainly did not dissapoint. In my opinion, this was hands-down the best performance of the event. The energy was incredible, and the variety of songs was perfect. The crowd got extremely hyped up when they needed to, and we were calm and attentive when we needed to be. The artists did a great job and put a ton of effor into the performance, with Tech singing and a ton of improvisation from both members. I absolutely loved this performance and it might have pushed DDS from being my favorite vaporwave artist to possibly my favorite musical artist.
</p> 
<h3>Christtt</h3>
<p>
After a small break, I went to see Christtt play. His set was famous from the first Electronicon as being a unique experience, and this was definently delivered again this time. For the first half, Christtt played classic tracks of his with a slideshow of various memes, art, and other images played through pretty quickly. some time through, A dialog appeared on screen and a repitive, trance-like track began playing. The dialog, which scrolled across the screen, was a journal entry of a seemingly tortured soul and his endeavours on a given day. This lasted quite a while, but I got completely lost with the repitive music and the weird, twisted journal entry I was reading. It really was quite something.
</p>
<h3>Telepath</h3>
<p>
Telepath was definently one of the artists I was most loooking forwards to before the event, and I was not dissapointed at all. The king of hypnogenic vaporwave was wearing a reaper costume and playing great hypnogenic vaporwave. Some way through, the crowd began to raise crystals as an offering to the vaporgod. Some of us also raised our cassette tapes, which was quite funny. Overall, an incredible and surreal experience.
</p>
<h3>George Clanton</h3>
<p>
Everyone was looking forwards to George. Although I didn't see his whole set, he played beyond his high expectations. He was crowdsurfing and he even brought Nick Hexum of 311 on-stage for a few songs. Great set.
</p>
<h3>Slayyter</h3>
<p>
Slayyter was probably the least vaporwave-y artist at the event. She definently did not let that get to her, and played one of the most exciting sets to the somewhat unfamiliar audience. Her music isn't my personal favorite but I still found myself dancing to "Daddy AF".
</p>
<h3>Televape</h3>
<p>
Next up was the iconic duo of Vaperror and Telepath. This one had a pretty small crowd, as most people were upstairs at the Saint Pepsi set. However, this actually created a cult-like atmosphere to the set. Even though I had never spoken to most of the people there, I could tell that they were all my homies. Needless to say, the set was great and was the best way I could think of to end the night.
</p>
<p>
<br>
Now that I've gone on about how much fun I had, let's talk about the merchandise I got at the event. Everyone got a free "100% ElectroniCON mixtape" which was really cool. On top of that, I bought a shirt from the first electronicon, a tape of HCMJ's (James from DDS) solo project, a vinyl with two singles from DDS's "Heavy Black Heart" (signed!), a tape of Christtt's "No Lives Matter" (signed!), a super-nice gooey-green vinyl of George Clanton's "100% Electrnica", and a 1/1 Vapor95 Jacket with a Gundam face on the back. Overall, I'm pretty much happy with every single purchase I made. All of the physicals are aesthetically great and play very well, I love the shirt. The Jacket is 100% polester, which sucks, but I love the design so much that that doesn't matter to me. <br>
The only regrets I have are 1) being the literal next person in line after the Yeule vinyl got sold out and 2) not attending the Vaperror set. I watched the Vaperror set and it looked like a ton of fun. The energy was off the charts and he slammed his laptop on the ground at the end, which is the most vaporwave thing you could ever do.<br>
Also, the event being over gave me blues. How was I supposed to return to normal life after that?
