I have always had an especially useless and awkward obsession over code styling. I have been extremely zealous of my personal programming styles.<br>
In the past, I have used tabs and the Allman style of indenting. However, in the past few weeks, I have been convinced of a whole new code indentation style: the "cozy style!". Well, anyways, I think this is certainly something everyone should do: devlop your own style! It's fun and unique. Of course, you still shouldn't be using this style, particularly if it is very awkward, on shared projects, but I digress.<br>
Now, you are probably rolling your eyes at my supreme autism. Howeve, <i>trust me,</i>, it's really fun. No, really. <i> It is.</i>
