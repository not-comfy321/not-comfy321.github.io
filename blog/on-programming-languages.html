<h1>On Programming Languages</h1>
<small>[<a href='../rblog.html#on-programming-languages'>link</a>&mdash;<a href='on-programming-languages.html'>standalone</a>]</small>
<p>Let me preface this blog by saying that I am not a particularly good
programmer. The extent of my programming skill comes in writing small scripts
in my free time. However, one thing that I <i>have</i> done quite a bit of is
learning to program. I have learned a couple of languages through self-teaching
and I have taken courses in programming in a variety of different environments.
I have also had a <i>friend or two</i> ask me about what programming language
they should start off with learning. And that got me thinking a little bit.
Personally, I started with C#. I think that C# is a great language to start to
learn to program with, but I will get into all of that later. Anyways, for the
time being, let me explain what, in my opinion, is the best way to learn to
program.<br>I think that in most cases, it is best to start off with an
<i>object-oriented</i>, or in the very least, <i>imperative</i> programming
language. If you are new to programming and don't know what that is, you can
just look up a list of them. Some examples include: C++, C#, Java, Rust, etc.
I would also recommend that you don't look up some stupid flowchart showing
what programming language to learn because those are 99% bullshit and you will
be learning more than one language in your career as a programmer (hopefully).
I think that object-oriented programming languages are best to start out with
because they are typically high-level, meaning they do not require much
knowledge of low-level computer science, and they are pretty easy and are quite
intuitive (most of the time). As for how to learn, you have a number of
options. You can take a course in the subject or you can self-teach whatever
you want to learn to yourself. Both have their advantages. For a course, you
will be forced to learn the programming language (or risk a poor grade in the
class). This is good because one of the biggest problems with self-teaching
a programming language is <i>actually sticking through</i>. It is very easy to
lose drive or motivation in the early stages of learning a programming
language. Another advantage to courses is that, of course, you can flex them on
documents, resumes, etc. Anyhow, if you are very <i>passionate</i> about
learning a programming language, I would argue that self-teaching is the
superior method of learning because a) You can learn at a much accelerated pace
and b) You can learn much more and apply your new knowledge much more quickly.
You can self-teach however fits your style, be that reading a book, watching
YouTube videos, or praying to God for knowledge and wisdom. After a few months
of learning an object oriented programming language, you will find that you
have at least minimal knowledge in most other imperative languages because they
are all relatively similar. Anyhow, this is when I believe one should learn
a <i>functional</i> programming language, such as Haskell, Scala, LISP, or even
shellscript. These will help you reconsider programming, and can be quite fun
for a more experience programmer. They will also diversify your programming
skills and open up the gates to shitpost in /dpg/ threads about how good
Haskell is. After you are familiar with a functional programming language, you
should have a pretty good understanding of programming and its concepts.
<i>This</i> is when you branch out and learn something new, whatever you want.
You can try to learn more low level languages - like C and Assembly. You can
try learning some math-related language. You can learn a new object oriented
language and write a big project. You can become adept in something you've
already learned. The possibilities are really endless. Before I close off this
blog, I just want to remind you: this is just what <i>I think</i>, and you
should really take it with a grain of salt. <i>Of course</i> there is no
objective best way or correct way to learn anything. Use your own intuition and
common sense. UwU. </p>
