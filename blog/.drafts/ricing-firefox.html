Firefox is, in my opinion, the most extensively customizable modern
mainstream web browser. The customizability of Firefox is, in fact, the
sole reason for which I prefer Firefox to, say, Ungoogled Chromium. There
are a few good guides out there, which I will be linking at the beggining
of each section, but they are scattered about. I think there should be one
universal and encompassing guide to ricing Firefox.

To start off, we will be reviewing one of the two of these four sections which
is not specific to Firefox: homepages. The concept is very simple:
a webpage which is functionally useful when you open a blank Firefox
window. It may include anything. Common elements include:<br>
-Links to frequently visited sites<br>
-Search bar<br>
-Weather<br>
-Autistic /biz/ crypto prices<br>
-Waifus telling you to have a nice day<br>
Point is, there is plenty of creativity you can use here, and its not inoften that I will
see someone do something new and cool in a homepage. To create a basic, /wg/ ready
homepage, you can simply make one using HTML+CSS (although you may need to write JS
scripts for some things, like weather). This can be done fairly easily. If you're lazy,
you can perform the age-old art of <i>stealing other people's shit</i>. See above, there
are tons and tons of homepages people make. I'm currently using one I stole off of someone
else (and changed a bit) but I am appaled at how bloated it is and I will probably write
my own soon. Once you have a homepage you like, it's time to apply it. You can host the
html file wherever you want. I reccomend hosting it on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>
. Once it's hosted, go to <a href="about:preferences#home">about:preferences</a>, and
change <b>Homepage and new windows</b> to <b>Custom URLs...</b>. This is all you need to do if you
just want to change your homepage. However, chances are, you also want to change your
newtab. Unfortunately, Firefox removed our ability to do custom newtabs a few updates ago,
so I use the plugin <a
			    href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/custom-new-tab-page/">
	Custom New Tab</a> to change the newtab page. Just set the newtab to your hosted
file, and you should be good to go.

<h3>II) Stylus</h3>
<p>
<b><i>Relevant Links: <a href="userstyles.org">Userstyles</a></i></b><br>
In case you're unaware, <a
				href=https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/>Stylus</a>
is a plugin for Firefox and Chrome that lets you use your own custom CSS on websites. The
tool is pretty cool and can lead to some very nice site designs. Stylus also lets you use
<b>Global Styles</b>, which is css that will apply to every website you visit. While it
may sound good to have a consistent style among all websites you visit, you soon realize
that Global Styles are autistic and will make 80% of websites look like garbage
(seriously, just don't use them). Admittedly, Stylus can be somewhat difficult to use
sometimes. It requires you to study the website's CSS and mostly involves a lot of
tinkering. I recommend writing CSS for only websites you frequent, if you value your time.
Of course, <a href=userstyles.org>userstyles.org</a> has a ton of good styles you can
steal. One thing to note, before I wrap up this section, is that I would NOT reccomend
writing Stylus CSS for 4chan. (INSERT SHILL MODE)
Use <a href="https://github.com/ccd0/4chan-x">4chan x</a>
+ <a href="https://github.com/KevinParnell/OneeChan">Oneechan</a> for a significantly
better browsing experience and a very easy and extensible customization system (LEAVE
SHILL MODE). You'll also need <a
				      href=https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/374723-oneechan-4channel-update>this</a>
*monkey script to use Oneechan now.

<h3>III) userchrome.css</h3>
<p>
Userchrome.css is one one of the best things about ricing firefox. It lets you change the
way the browser's interface looks, including things like the
