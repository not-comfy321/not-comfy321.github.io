<h2 id='100-electronicon-la'>100% Electronicon LA</h2>
<small>[<a href='#100-electronicon-la'>link</a>&mdash;<a href='blog/100-electronicon-la.html'>standalone</a>]</small>
<p>
Last weekened I attended 100% ElectroniCON 2 in Los Angeles, and I had a great experience. In case you're unfamiliar, this is the second installment in a series of vaporwave-centered music festivals (vaporwave, for the unfamiliar, is an cultish internet-born music genre with emphasis on a musical and visual surreal aesthetic, with a huge range of sounds and distinct styles). I am now making a blog post to share my experience with the festival and talk about the artists, people, and merchandise of the event.<br>
The simplest way to describe the experience is really to just say that it was a ton of fun. It was incredible to see such a weird and almost entirely anonymous and internet-based community come together in real life. Almost everyone there was, quite clearly, a big vaporwave fan and I had a countless number of discussions with other atendees. The event was a 10 hour beast that went from 2pm to midnight on a Saturday, followed by another couple hours at an afterparty that I unfortunately couldn't attend because I'm too young (this event was also my first time seeing live music, so that might have put particular weight on it). I met people who I only knew from vaporwave Discord servers and I made more than one new friend. I was amazed by the community and how nice everyone was. Of course, I didn't attend Electronicon to talk to people. So, what artists did I see and how were they?<br>
</p>
<h3>Equip</h3>
<p>
The first artist I saw was Equip, known for his video-game-OST-modelling vaporwave records and aquatic style. Equip was wearing his crazy Cursebreaker X costume, featuring pointy ears and a horn on his head (he actually gave his ears to the audience). It was a great set, but to be honest it was probably my personal least favorite of the festival. There was decent energy from the audience and the artist himself was very down-to-earth. In fact, there was nothing <em>bad</em> about his performance at all. He even got Vaperror to make a surprise appearance for the last song, which was hype as hell. It just wasn't quite as spectacular as the others.
</p>
<h3>FrankJavCee</h3>
<p>
Next, I saw FrankJavCee play. FrankJavCee is a Youtuber who has made a lot of videos related to obscure internet music (like vaporwave) which are filled with memes and fun. So, naturally, his performance was pretty meme-heavy. This had quite an effect, and a positive one. When "Thicc Boy Season" played, I realized what I was in for. Not long after, I got knocked over moshing to "Everybody Gangsta 'til the Pants Start Walking". He also got his girlfriend to sing, which was great. I met some friends at the set and all-around had a great time.
</p> 
<h3>INTERNET CLUB</h3>
<p>
Internet Club was next. This was his first time ever performing live. I was at the set very early and very excited to hear him. Despite some rude remarcks from some asshole in the audience who didn't appreciate his slow trance-like style, his performance was really good. I got a bit lost listening to the long hypnogenic drones of Internet Club.
</p> 
<h3>Yeule</h3>
<p>
Next up was up-and-coming dreampop singer Yeule. I only caught the second half of Yeule, but it was still a respectable and fun performance. Yeule's style is probably not the best when played live, but I think she dealt with it perfectly.
</p> 
<h3>Death's Dynamic Shroud</h3>
<p>
After Yeule, I got ready for the DDS performance. DDS is probably my single favorite vaporwave artist so I made sure to show up early as to secure a position in the front. Tech and James were present, and they certainly did not dissapoint. In my opinion, this was hands-down the best performance of the event. The energy was incredible, and the variety of songs was perfect. The crowd got extremely hyped up when they needed to, and we were calm and attentive when we needed to be. The artists did a great job and put a ton of effor into the performance, with Tech singing and a ton of improvisation from both members. I absolutely loved this performance and it might have pushed DDS from being my favorite vaporwave artist to possibly my favorite musical artist.
</p> 
<h3>Christtt</h3>
<p>
After a small break, I went to see Christtt play. His set was famous from the first Electronicon as being a unique experience, and this was definently delivered again this time. For the first half, Christtt played classic tracks of his with a slideshow of various memes, art, and other images played through pretty quickly. some time through, A dialog appeared on screen and a repitive, trance-like track began playing. The dialog, which scrolled across the screen, was a journal entry of a seemingly tortured soul and his endeavours on a given day. This lasted quite a while, but I got completely lost with the repitive music and the weird, twisted journal entry I was reading. It really was quite something.
</p>
<h3>Telepath</h3>
<p>
Telepath was definently one of the artists I was most loooking forwards to before the event, and I was not dissapointed at all. The king of hypnogenic vaporwave was wearing a reaper costume and playing great hypnogenic vaporwave. Some way through, the crowd began to raise crystals as an offering to the vaporgod. Some of us also raised our cassette tapes, which was quite funny. Overall, an incredible and surreal experience.
</p>
<h3>George Clanton</h3>
<p>
Everyone was looking forwards to George. Although I didn't see his whole set, he played beyond his high expectations. He was crowdsurfing and he even brought Nick Hexum of 311 on-stage for a few songs. Great set.
</p>
<h3>Slayyter</h3>
<p>
Slayyter was probably the least vaporwave-y artist at the event. She definently did not let that get to her, and played one of the most exciting sets to the somewhat unfamiliar audience. Her music isn't my personal favorite but I still found myself dancing to "Daddy AF".
</p>
<h3>Televape</h3>
<p>
Next up was the iconic duo of Vaperror and Telepath. This one had a pretty small crowd, as most people were upstairs at the Saint Pepsi set. However, this actually created a cult-like atmosphere to the set. Even though I had never spoken to most of the people there, I could tell that they were all my homies. Needless to say, the set was great and was the best way I could think of to end the night.
</p>
<p>
<br>
Now that I've gone on about how much fun I had, let's talk about the merchandise I got at the event. Everyone got a free "100% ElectroniCON mixtape" which was really cool. On top of that, I bought a shirt from the first electronicon, a tape of HCMJ's (James from DDS) solo project, a vinyl with two singles from DDS's "Heavy Black Heart" (signed!), a tape of Christtt's "No Lives Matter" (signed!), a super-nice gooey-green vinyl of George Clanton's "100% Electrnica", and a 1/1 Vapor95 Jacket with a Gundam face on the back. Overall, I'm pretty much happy with every single purchase I made. All of the physicals are aesthetically great and play very well, I love the shirt. The Jacket is 100% polester, which sucks, but I love the design so much that that doesn't matter to me. <br>
The only regrets I have are 1) being the literal next person in line after the Yeule vinyl got sold out and 2) not attending the Vaperror set. I watched the Vaperror set and it looked like a ton of fun. The energy was off the charts and he slammed his laptop on the ground at the end, which is the most vaporwave thing you could ever do.<br>
Also, the event being over gave me blues. How was I supposed to return to normal life after that?

<h2 id='on-programming-languages'>On Programming Languages</h2>
<small>[<a href='#on-programming-languages'>link</a>&mdash;<a href='blog/on-programming-languages.html'>standalone</a>]</small>
<p>Let me preface this blog by saying that I am not a particularly good
programmer. The extent of my programming skill comes in writing small scripts
in my free time. However, one thing that I <i>have</i> done quite a bit of is
learning to program. I have learned a couple of languages through self-teaching
and I have taken courses in programming in a variety of different environments.
I have also had a <i>friend or two</i> ask me about what programming language
they should start off with learning. And that got me thinking a little bit.
Personally, I started with C#. I think that C# is a great language to start to
learn to program with, but I will get into all of that later. Anyways, for the
time being, let me explain what, in my opinion, is the best way to learn to
program.<br>I think that in most cases, it is best to start off with an
<i>object-oriented</i>, or in the very least, <i>imperative</i> programming
language. If you are new to programming and don't know what that is, you can
just look up a list of them. Some examples include: C++, C#, Java, Rust, etc.
I would also recommend that you don't look up some stupid flowchart showing
what programming language to learn because those are 99% bullshit and you will
be learning more than one language in your career as a programmer (hopefully).
I think that object-oriented programming languages are best to start out with
because they are typically high-level, meaning they do not require much
knowledge of low-level computer science, and they are pretty easy and are quite
intuitive (most of the time). As for how to learn, you have a number of
options. You can take a course in the subject or you can self-teach whatever
you want to learn to yourself. Both have their advantages. For a course, you
will be forced to learn the programming language (or risk a poor grade in the
class). This is good because one of the biggest problems with self-teaching
a programming language is <i>actually sticking through</i>. It is very easy to
lose drive or motivation in the early stages of learning a programming
language. Another advantage to courses is that, of course, you can flex them on
documents, resumes, etc. Anyhow, if you are very <i>passionate</i> about
learning a programming language, I would argue that self-teaching is the
superior method of learning because a) You can learn at a much accelerated pace
and b) You can learn much more and apply your new knowledge much more quickly.
You can self-teach however fits your style, be that reading a book, watching
YouTube videos, or praying to God for knowledge and wisdom. After a few months
of learning an object oriented programming language, you will find that you
have at least minimal knowledge in most other imperative languages because they
are all relatively similar. Anyhow, this is when I believe one should learn
a <i>functional</i> programming language, such as Haskell, Scala, LISP, or even
shellscript. These will help you reconsider programming, and can be quite fun
for a more experience programmer. They will also diversify your programming
skills and open up the gates to shitpost in /dpg/ threads about how good
Haskell is. After you are familiar with a functional programming language, you
should have a pretty good understanding of programming and its concepts.
<i>This</i> is when you branch out and learn something new, whatever you want.
You can try to learn more low level languages - like C and Assembly. You can
try learning some math-related language. You can learn a new object oriented
language and write a big project. You can become adept in something you've
already learned. The possibilities are really endless. Before I close off this
blog, I just want to remind you: this is just what <i>I think</i>, and you
should really take it with a grain of salt. <i>Of course</i> there is no
objective best way or correct way to learn anything. Use your own intuition and
common sense. UwU. </p>

<h2 id='ricing-firefox'>Ricing Firefox</h2>
<small>[<a href='#ricing-firefox'>link</a>&mdash;<a href='blog/ricing-firefox.html'>standalone</a>]</small>
<p>
<img src=browser.png>
Firefox is, in my opinion, the most extensively customizable modern
mainstream web browser. The customizability of Firefox is, in fact, the
sole reason for which I prefer Firefox to, say, Ungoogled Chromium. There
are a few good guides out there, which I will be linking at the beginning
of each section, but they are scattered about. I think there should be one
universal and encompassing guide to ricing Firefox.
</p>
<h2> Contents </h2>
<ul>
	<li>I) Homepage/New Tab Page</li>
	<li>II) Stylus</li>
	<li>III) Userchrome.css</li>
	<li>IV) Themes</li>
</ul>
<h2>I) Homepage/New Tab Page</h2>
<p>
<i><b>Relevant Links: <a href="https://www.4chan.org/wg/html-css">/wg/ thread</a>,<a
			 href="https://pastebin.com/ZJvDn0eN"> a pastebin, </a><a
			 href=https://startpages.github.io/>Startpage Emporium</a>
	</b></i><br>
	To start off, we will be reviewing one of the two of these four sections which
	is not specific to Firefox: homepages. The concept is very simple:
	a webpage which is functionally useful when you open a blank Firefox
	window. It may include anything. Common elements include:<br>
	-Links to frequently visited sites<br>
	-Search bar<br>
	-Weather<br>
	-Autistic /biz/ crypto prices<br>
	-Waifus telling you to have a nice day<br>
	Point is, there is plenty of creativity you can use here, and its not rare that I will
	see someone do something new and cool in a homepage. To create a basic, /wg/ ready
	homepage, you can simply make one using HTML+CSS (although you may need to write JS
	scripts for some things, like weather). This can be done fairly easily. If you're lazy,
	you can perform the age-old art of <i>stealing other people's shit</i>. See above, there
	are tons and tons of homepages people make. I'm currently using one I stole off of someone
	else (and changed a bit) but I am appalled at how bloated it is and I will probably write
	my own soon. Once you have a homepage you like, it's time to apply it. You can host the
	html file wherever you want. I recommend hosting it on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>
	. Once it's hosted, go to <a href="about:preferences#home">about:preferences</a>, and
	change <b>Homepage and new windows</b> to <b>Custom URLs...</b>. This is all you need to do if you
	just want to change your homepage. However, chances are, you also want to change your
	newtab. Unfortunately, Firefox removed our ability to do custom newtabs a few updates ago,
	so I use the plugin <a
				    href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/addon/custom-new-tab-page/">
		Custom New Tab</a> to change the newtab page. Just set the newtab to your hosted
	file, and you should be good to go.
</p>
<h2>II) Stylus</h2>
<p>
<b><i>Relevant Links: <a href="userstyles.org">Userstyles</a></i></b><br>
In case you're unaware, <a
				href=https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/addon/styl-us/>Stylus</a>
is a plugin for Firefox and Chrome that lets you use your own custom CSS on websites. The
tool is pretty cool and can lead to some very nice site designs. Stylus also lets you use
<b>Global Styles</b>, which is css that will apply to every website you visit. While it
may sound good to have a consistent style among all websites you visit, you soon realize
that Global Styles are autistic and will make 80% of websites look like garbage
(seriously, just don't use them). Admittedly, Stylus can be somewhat difficult to use
sometimes. It requires you to study the website's CSS and mostly involves a lot of
tinkering. I recommend writing CSS for only websites you frequent, if you value your time.
Of course, <a href=userstyles.org>userstyles.org</a> has a ton of good styles you can
steal. One thing to note, before I wrap up this section, is that I would NOT recommend
writing Stylus CSS for 4chan. (INSERT SHILL MODE)
Use <a href="https://github.com/ccd0/4chan-x">4chan x</a>
+ <a href="https://github.com/KevinParnell/OneeChan">Oneechan</a> for a significantly
better browsing experience and a very easy and extensible customization system (LEAVE
SHILL MODE). You'll also need <a
				      href=https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/374723-oneechan-4channel-update>this</a>
*monkey script to use Oneechan now.
</p>
<h2>III) userchrome.css</h2>
<p>
<b><i>Relevant Links: <a href=https://www.userchrome.org/>Userchrome.org</a>, <a
			 href=https://www.reddit.com/r/FirefoxCSS>/r/Firefoxcss</a>
</b></i>
Userchrome.css is one one of the best things about ricing Firefox. It lets you change the
way the browser's interface looks, including (almost) everything from tabs to
scrollbars. It can be a little tricky to actually get started with a userChrome.css file. 
<b>Create userchrome.css</b> in <b>~/.mozilla/chrome</b> (create this folder if
necessary.).
To be honest, userchrome.css can be much more difficult to tinker with than site styles.
You will have to become familiar with the wack-ass Firefox CSS elements and, if you want
to do anything other than recolor stuff on the browser, you will require a more extended
knowledge of CSS. That is why I recommend stealing something off of <a
									    href=https://www.reddit.com/r/Firefoxcss>/r/Firefoxcss</a>
and modifying it to your liking (Sorting by top...all time can give you actual themes and
not just questions). Me, being the lazy fuaarrrrk that I am use a modified version of <a
											      href=https://www.reddit.com/r/FirefoxCSS/comments/7ignsk/oneline_flat_interface_dark_light/>
this</a>. 
</p>
<h2>Themes</h2>
<p>
Last, but not least (actually, yes, least) are Firefox themes. Firefox themes are
necessary to color things like the URL bar which cannot be changed by userchrome.css. You
can find many Firefox themes on the <a
					    href=https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/themes/>Firefox
					    Addons Catalog</a>
However, you will find that <i>LITERALLY EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE</i> is <i>garbage</i>.
Seriously, it's astounding how bad these are. So, what we will do is make our own Firefox
theme. Making a theme isn't too bad, but applying one can be a pain. To make a theme, you
should go about like you were making any Firefox addon. Create a <b>manifest.json</b> file
and populate it like this: (this is my theme)
<pre><code>
{
"manifest_version": 2,
"name": "fft",
"version": "0.3",
"theme": {
    "colors": {
       "accentcolor": "#0c0c0c",
       "textcolor": "white",
       "toolbar": "#0c0c0c",
       "toolbar_text": "white",
       "toolbar_field": "#0c0c0c",
       "toolbar_field_border": "#0c0c0c",
       "toolbar_field_text": "white",
       "toolbar_top_separator": "#ffa64f",
       "toolbar_bottom_separator": "#0c0c0c",
       "toolbar_vertical_separator": "#0c0c0c"
    }
  }
}
</pre></code>
Then package it into a .zip or .xpi:
<code> zip -r -FS theme.zip * </code>
Now that you have this, we can "test" out the theme.
<ul>
	<li>1) Go to <a href="about:debugging">about:debugging</a></li>
	<li>2) Click "Load Temporary Add-On"</li>
	<li>3) Choose your file.</li>
</ul>
HOWEVER!!!<br>
Doing this, every time you restart Firefox, you will have lost your theme. So in order to
avert this ill fate, we will (prepare yourself) PUBLISH OUR THEME. Thanks """MOZ://A""".
So, basically you will have to go through a small process to get your theme published. 
<ul>
	<li>1)Visit <a href=https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/>Firefox Addons</a> and
	make a """MOZ://A""" account</li>
	<li>2)Go to the <a href=https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/">developer
			club</a> and click <b>Submit a New Add-on</b></li>

</ul>
<br><br>
Anyways, this is just a very bare bones guide to ricing Firefox. For specific details, use
the sources at the top of each section and google. Maybe ask around in /wg/ or /g/
threads. Have a nice day!

<h2 id='how-this-website-is-hosted'>How this Website is Hosted</h2>
<small>[<a href='#how-this-website-is-hosted'>link</a>&mdash;<a href='blog/how-this-website-is-hosted.html'>standalone</a>]</small>
<p>
For my first real blog entry, I am going to write about <i>how</i> I am hosting this website. It is currently costing me a whole $2 a year to keep up, in total. The first thing I did was, well, make the 
website. This is the bulk of the process. If you are making a personal website, however, I would say this step should not be difficult at all. For 99% of "personal sites" (like this) pretty much nothing
other HTML+CSS is necessary. If you don't already know how to write in HTML and CSS, don't worry, it literally requires the intellect of an ape. <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">This site</a> has some
pretty good guides on writing both HTML and CSS. For the blog, you can very easily just manualy write your own blog and change the blog html file for each new entry. However, a very convenient sub-80 line
script called <a href="https://www.github.com/lukesmithxyz/lb">lb</a> exists for this very purpose. The script lets you write blog posts in their own files, then automatically adds them to an rss feed, 
rolling blog, and generates standalone pages for each of them. I have found the script to be tremendously useful, and I am using it with this website. Once you have made your website, if you are writing a
very simple personal site (like this one) you can host your site with <a href="https://pages.github.com/">github pages</a> (or gitlab pages, I guess). This website is being hosted on the github page of 
github profile <i>notcomfy321</i>. (Because my main github profile's github pages is my browser homepage). Once your site is on github pages, buy a domain (must be apex or www). I bought one from
<a href="https://www.epik.com/">epik</a>, although I cannot reccomend it. You can use a plethora of other domain providers, such as NameCheap or BarelyFreeSpeach. Next, follow the directions 
<a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/using-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages">here</a> to have your url point to the github pages site. In my case, I had to change the A records of my domain to 
point to GitHub and added a CNAME to my directory with my url on it. And... that's pretty much it. It was incredibly simple and easy process. Of course, the use of a github pages site does limit the
flexibility and power of your site. However, referencing my previous point, I do not believe that a personal site really needs anything other than HTML and CSS. I would argue that there are some benefits 
from hosting your site on Github Pages. Your website is kept on a git repository, meaning that every time you commit to that repository, your website will update immediately. You can also edit the site
from any device, anywhere. You can add more contributors too, who can also commit changes to your website, if you desire.
